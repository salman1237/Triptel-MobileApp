## Session 0 — 2026-11-04 — Harness written, no app code yet

**Did:**
- Created this repo (`D:\eSim\Triptel-MobileApp`), independent git history from
  the main `D:\eSim` web+backend monorepo.
- Explored the live Triptel web app + backend end to end (every consumer route,
  API endpoint, model, and service — explicitly excluding admin/merchant/agent
  panels) to make sure the harness docs don't miss a user feature.
- Wrote the full harness: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/Architecture.md`,
  `docs/Rules.md`, `docs/Technical_Requirements.md`,
  `docs/Functional_Requirements.md` (50 FR items), `docs/Non_Functional_Requirements.md`,
  `feature_list.json` (one item per FR, all `not_started`), `DECISIONS.md`,
  `init.sh`, `.claude/settings.json`, a destructive-command hook, and two skills
  (`new-screen`, `new-api-integration`).
- Stack decided: Expo (managed) + TypeScript + Expo Router + TanStack Query +
  Zustand + `expo-secure-store` + `react-native-qrcode-svg` + `expo-web-browser`.
  Full rationale in `docs/Architecture.md`; decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

**No feature code exists yet.** `F-000` (project initialized) is `not_started`.

**Known open questions, flagged not solved:**
- How ShurjoPay hands control back to the app (custom-scheme redirect vs. manual
  return + poll) — needs resolving before FR-306/FR-602 are built. See
  `docs/Architecture.md` → "Payment".
- Whether KYC (FR-1002) ships in the first release or is deferred — most users
  never withdraw. Flagged for a stakeholder call before FR-702/FR-1002.
- Push notifications and deep links are backend gaps, not app gaps — don't try to
  build around them; see `CLAUDE.md` → "Known Gaps".

**Next step:** run `init.sh` to produce a runnable Expo app with one passing test,
then start `F-000`, then `FR-107` (session restore) before anything that needs
auth, since almost everything downstream depends on it.
